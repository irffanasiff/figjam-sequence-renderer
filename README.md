This repository contains a simple Next.js frontend and the source for a Figma plugin used to render Mermaid sequence diagrams. The Next.js portion was generated using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Figma Plugin

The `code.ts` file contains a Figma plugin that reads Mermaid sequence diagram syntax and renders the diagram directly in FigJam. To build the plugin JavaScript file run:

```bash
npm run build:figma
```

The compiled `code.js` along with `ui.html` is referenced in `manifest.json`. After building, you can load the plugin in Figma by choosing **Import Plugin from Manifestâ€¦** and selecting the `manifest.json` in this project.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
